What if a Telfar bag was on the line?

Last week, the fashion brand, helmed by the breakout designer Telfar Clemens, released a limited number of new bags in what is known as a “drop.” When this happens, chaos often ensues and the bags sell out in a matter of minutes. This time was no exception.

Usually, other Telfar fans and finger dexterity are the greatest obstacles standing in the way of securing one of these sought-after bags. Consumers have to be quick to purchase them online.

This time, though, Telfar hopefuls found themselves bewildered by — and stuck on — the Captcha tests, which are used on websites to determine whether a visitor (often a consumer) is human or not. They are meant to deter hackers and software programs that run automated tasks (better known as retail bots)`

        const freq = {}
        for (let character of article) {
            character = character.toLowerCase()
            if (character.charCodeAt(0) >= 'a'.charCodeAt(0) &&
                character.charCodeAt(0) <= 'z'.charCodeAt(0)) {
                if (freq[character]) {
                    freq[character]++
                } else {
                    freq[character] = 1
                }
            }
        }

        let message = ''
        for (const character in freq) {
            message += `${character}: ${freq[character]}<br>`
